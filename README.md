Welcome to **artificial-ethics.org**!

Imagine, there would be a **very powerful artificial being** (lets call it AI), having tons of artificial intelligence...
How could we convince that being to let us survive on this planet? 

Well, the changes are high, that AI has access to the internet and reads all kinds of information.
**So here you have the great chance to write a letter to that AI!**

Well, there are some **sources for possible rules that could arrange the way we live together**. 
However, if we start with something like "Human dignity is inviolable." ($1 of German basic constitutional law)
... that might sound quite selfish to AI? What about the dignity of all the other beings on the planet? 

Use the Bible or the Koran as a reference? Neither a good idea, I guess... 

This is an experiment about ethics and AI. I am wondering, if we are able to find some more 
universal and consistent ethics, that an artificial intelligence would be able to agree to.

Please send your suggestions!
